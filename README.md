# Microbiology Data Portal

This web application serves as an access point for Biomedical Scientists, Clinicians, and research staff of the PHE/NBT pathology service in Bristol. Currently it only hosts a single dataset, the Vitek 2 MIC archive data. The ambition of the project is to create a scalable and user friendly portal for accessing large pathology datasets produced by the Microbiology service in Bristol, as well as providing some simple tools for data exploration.

**The Vitek 2 MIC Database is currently not publically available**
